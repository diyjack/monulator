monulator-usb-avr8
==================

Data visualization gadget featuring an analog panel meter and RGB LED
controlled over USB. More information in [this blog post](http://www.sharebrained.com/2012/05/30/the-monulator/).

Status
======

This board has been fabricated and assembled, and works well. The
project is still under heavy development, so expect radical changes
in the design.

Bill of Materials
=================

See the included monulator-usb-avr8-bom.csv. I believe it's up-to-date with the
components and values I used in my last build of this board. But do re-check
against the respective datasheets.
